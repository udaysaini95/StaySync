# StaySync Authorization Model

StaySync uses three server-side authorization layers. The browser is never an authority for role or ownership decisions.

1. Authentication verifies the signed access token and creates `req.user` from validated claims.
2. Permission middleware checks a named capability against the canonical role matrix.
3. Resource policy checks ownership or an explicit broader-access permission after the record is loaded.

Unknown roles and unknown permissions are denied by default. Administrative access is explicit rather than an unconditional bypass; for example, administrators can review leave applications but cannot submit student leave applications.

## Current role boundaries

- Students operate on their own profile, complaints, leave applications, and mess submissions.
- Only students receive the `student-profile:read:self` and
  `student-profile:update:self` permissions. The profile API derives ownership
  from the authenticated subject and has no ID-based student route.
- Wardens may review operational complaints, leaves, mess records, and read gate activity, but cannot log gate movements.
- Wardens may search resident directory rows only for hostels in their explicit
  memberships. Administrators may search the institution-wide directory.
- Maintenance users can read only complaints with an active assignment to their
  account. They can start and resolve only their own active assignments. They
  cannot assign work or read another technician's queue.
- Wardens can assign and reassign complaints only inside their hostel
  memberships. Administrators can assign across hostels. In both cases, the
  assignee must be an active maintenance user in the complaint hostel.
- Only the student who reported a resolved complaint can close it or reopen it.
  Reopening requires a reason. Closing ends the technician's active assignment;
  the database permits this student action only after the complaint is closed.
- Guards may verify passes, log gate movement, read gate activity, and use shared mess participation features.
- Administrators receive explicitly listed institution-level operational and account-management permissions.
- Approved-student search, revocation, reinstatement, and activation-email
  reissue require the administrator-only `student-approval:manage` permission.
- Validated CSV approval imports require the separate administrator-only
  `student:import` permission. Wardens cannot use the preview or confirmed
  import endpoint.

Audit visibility is additionally filtered after the route permission check:
administrators can read all events, wardens can read operational events for
their assigned hostels, guards can read gate events for their assigned hostels,
and maintenance users can read only events they performed. Students cannot use
the audit API.

Staff provisioning and suspension rules are documented in [Staff Account Lifecycle](./STAFF_ACCOUNT_LIFECYCLE.md).
The student identity and email-verification flow is documented in [Approved Student Activation](./STUDENT_ACTIVATION.md).
The private profile response and editable fields are documented in [Student Profile API](./STUDENT_PROFILES.md).
Resident search fields and hostel visibility are documented in [Resident Directory API](./RESIDENT_DIRECTORY.md).
The append-only audit model is documented in [Audit Logging](./AUDIT_LOGGING.md).
The bulk approval boundary is documented in [Student CSV Imports](./STUDENT_IMPORTS.md).

Protected endpoints return `AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED` when no valid actor exists and `PERMISSION_DENIED` when the authenticated role lacks the requested capability. Ownership failures return `RESOURCE_ACCESS_DENIED`.

## Multi-hostel isolation boundary

Role and record-ownership enforcement is active now. Normalized resident,
room, and complaint APIs enforce assigned-hostel isolation. Complete isolation
is not yet available for legacy leave, gate, and mess records because they do
not all contain an authoritative hostel foreign key. Role checks must not be
mistaken for hostel-membership checks.
