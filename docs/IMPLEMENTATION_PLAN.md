# StaySync Engineering Implementation Plan

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Plan version | 1.0 |
| Status | Active |
| Date | 2026-09-01 |
| Product source | `docs/PRD.md` |
| Design source | `docs/FRONTEND_DESIGN_GUIDELINES.md` |
| Delivery model | One verified, commit-sized slice at a time |

## 1. Purpose

This plan converts the StaySync PRD into a sequence of small engineering changes. It is intentionally ordered so that security, data integrity, and reproducibility are established before large feature work.

Only one numbered slice should be implemented at a time. A slice must be verified and committed before the next slice begins unless the user explicitly requests otherwise.

## 2. Working agreement

For every implementation slice:

1. Re-read the mapped PRD requirements and relevant design sections.
2. Inspect the current worktree and preserve unrelated user changes.
3. State the exact slice boundary before editing.
4. Change only the files required for that slice.
5. Add or update tests in the same slice when the behavior can be tested.
6. Run the verification commands listed for the slice.
7. Review the final diff for secrets, generated artifacts, and unrelated changes.
8. Report what changed, what was verified, and any remaining limitation.
9. Provide one Conventional Commit message and exact-path staging guidance.
10. Wait for the user to commit or explicitly request the next slice.

Rules:

- Do not use `git add .` while unrelated changes exist.
- Do not combine cleanup, redesign, and business behavior in one commit.
- Do not silently change a PRD decision while implementing code.
- Do not use `drizzle-kit push` as a substitute for versioned migrations in the final workflow.
- Do not delete legacy code until its lack of reachability is reconfirmed and the deletion is the declared slice.
- Do not introduce fake dashboard/menu values to make unfinished screens look complete.
- Do not begin P1/P2 product scope while a prerequisite P0 exit gate is failing.

## 3. Commit and verification convention

Commit prefixes:

- `fix:` corrects existing behavior or security.
- `feat:` adds product capability.
- `refactor:` changes structure without changing intended behavior.
- `test:` adds or reorganizes test coverage only.
- `docs:` updates documentation only.
- `chore:` changes tooling, CI, dependencies, or developer workflow.
- `perf:` makes a measured performance improvement.

Each commit message in this plan is the recommended default. It may be adjusted if the final slice boundary changes.

Baseline verification commands should eventually converge on:

```powershell
npm.cmd run lint
npm.cmd run typecheck
npm.cmd test
npm.cmd run build
```

The exact commands will initially run from `Backend` and `Frontend` until a root workspace command is added.

## 4. Current baseline constraints

The plan begins from the audited repository state:

- React/Vite frontend with one active `src/pages` tree and a disconnected legacy UI.
- Express/Drizzle/Neon backend with controller-heavy modules.
- Database schema newer than the checked-in migration.
- Public registration currently accepts a client-provided privileged role.
- JWT fallback secret and non-expiring tokens currently exist.
- Frontend routes are not protected.
- Gate state transitions are not enforced transactionally.
- Uploads and PDFs are served publicly from local disk.
- Frontend lint currently fails.
- Automated tests, CI, deployment, and operational documentation are incomplete.

Before each slice, current Git state remains authoritative because the user may commit or edit between slices.

## 5. Delivery overview

## 8. First implementation slice specification

The first source-code slice after the documentation baseline is `AUTH-01`.

### AUTH-01 objective

Eliminate the current privilege-escalation path in which public registration accepts a client-provided `role`.

### AUTH-01 exact boundary

Included:

- Define canonical role constants used by the registration policy.
- Ensure public registration always persists the `STUDENT` role.
- Ignore/reject attempts to choose a staff role, using the behavior selected during implementation review.
- Add regression coverage for attempted privileged public registration.
- Update only directly affected API documentation/example payloads if present.

Excluded:

- Admin staff-provisioning UI/API; that is `AUTH-05`.
- JWT expiry; that is `AUTH-03`.
- Full RBAC refactor; that is `AUTH-04`.
- Frontend protected routes; that is `FE-05`.
- General validation/error middleware; that is `API-01`.
- Database role enum migration unless the implementation cannot safely centralize roles without it; otherwise that belongs with `DB-01`.

### AUTH-01 verification evidence

- Student registration succeeds and returns `student`.
- Requests submitting `admin`, `warden`, `maintenance`, or `guard` cannot obtain those roles.
- Existing login behavior remains functional.
- Backend syntax/tests pass.
- Final diff contains no unrelated auth middleware or legacy frontend edits.

### AUTH-01 commit

```text
fix(auth): restrict public registration to students
```

## 9. Slice completion report template

Use this structure after every implemented slice:

```markdown
Implemented: <slice ID and name>

Changed:
- <observable behavior>
- <tests or migration>

Verified:
- `<command>` — passed
- `<command>` — passed

Not included:
- <explicit next-slice work>

Commit:
`<conventional commit message>`

Stage only:
`git add <exact changed paths>`
```

## 10. Plan change policy

This plan may be revised when implementation reveals a real dependency, but changes must be explicit:

- Explain why the existing order or boundary is unsafe or inefficient.
- Update the affected slice definition before broadening it.
- Preserve the one-slice/one-commit rule.
- Keep the PRD requirement coverage map accurate.
- Record product-scope changes in the PRD, not only in this implementation plan.
